### **GAME LOGIC**

[FLOWCHART](project-management/Silvia_gameProject_flowChart.jpg)
1. The player will be asked to type his/her name in the landing page input field;
1. he will click a 'Start' button to load the game page;
1. all the tiles will be displayed flipped with their back up;
1. a clock will start running;
1. the player can start guessing clicking on two tiles each turn;
1. once a tile is clicked, the card will flip and reveal the image;
1. if the player finds a matching pair, the tiles stay flipped up and he can play an other turn;
1. if the two tiles are not matching, they will flip back over;
1. the game will end when the player will find all the matching pairs;
1. Finally, a congratulation message will be displayed on the page.

---------------------------------

### **FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**

- COUNTDOWN TIMER: the clock could be converted in a countdown timer.
- DIFFICULTY LEVELS: the game could have two or more difficulty levels, corresponding to different countdown timer settings.
- DECREASING SCORE: the score could be converted from number of right guesses to regular points. For every righ guess, the player can earn 10 points. 
For every wrong guess, the score can be decreased by 1 point, starting from the fourth or fifth attempt. In this case, the game could end also when the player score reaches 0.
- HIDDEN PICTURE: every time a matching pair is found, the two tiles will disappear and show part of the big picture hidden under the tiles.
- MORE ANIMATIONS: Add more than one animation. For instance, zoom in on a tile when it is flipped, to show the content bigger.
- MUSIC!
